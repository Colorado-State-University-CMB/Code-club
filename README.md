# Code-club
Code club: a meeting group for help on bio coding and analysis. Currently, we informally sit down and discuss coding approaches, provide help, and point to resources.

**When and Where:** AZ E210, Fridays 12:00pm-2pm.

## Help us grow as a resource!
 
We are a small group, but you can help us grow as a resource by submitting questions (below), or a request an in-depth discussion topic (below) for an in-person meeting of the club. 

## The code club discussion board on github.com
